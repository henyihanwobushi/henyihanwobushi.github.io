Go is a board game for two players that originated in China more than 2,500 years ago. The game is noted for being rich in strategy despite its relatively simple rules. [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game))

## Rules

### Board

The game is played on a grid of lines (usually 19×19). Game pieces, called stones, are played on the lines' intersections.

### Players

One player uses the white stones and the other, black. The players take turns placing stones of their color on the intersections of the board. Once played, stones are not moved; however, if they are surrounded by opposing stones on all orthogonally-adjacent points, they are captured and removed from the board.

### Goal

The goal of the game is to surround more territory than the opponent. The game ends and the score is counted when both players consecutively pass on a turn, indicating that neither side can increase its territory or reduce its opponent's.

### Scoring

The score is the number of empty points enclosed by a player's stones, plus the number of stones captured by that player. [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game))

## Skills

### Life and Death

Life and death is a fundamental concept in the game of Go. It is related to the status of a group of stones: stones must have at least one liberty to remain on the board. [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_and_death)

## Learned Skills

The goal of the game is to surround more territory than the opponent.

### Global

The board of weiqi is a 19x19 grid, and there are some scales of view

- The stones is not important, but the territory is, so if the territory is safe, a little loss of stones is acceptable.
- The invasion is important, but always keep an eye on the territory you have.
- The territory is not safe before there is not space for the opponent to make a life.

### Opening
In the opening of the game, the corners and sides are more important than the center of the board.

  
### Middle Game




### End Game

The territory is not safe before there is not space for the opponent to make a life. So if you have a big territory, you should take care of the space you have before you opponent make a real invasion.
