## Complexity

Human brain works like a prediction machine, which predicts the future based on the past, and when then prediction fails, we learn from the error.

But when the system is too complex, we fails too often, then there is too much to learn, and the learning process is overwhelmed.

The world we live in is complex, but before the information revolution, we can only see a small part of the world, so we can still learn and adapt to the world. The Internet brings us so much information that we all cheasing the fast changing world, everyday is a new day, there always new things. We are lost at the sea of information.

Before we finally learn how to live with the Internet, there is a new revolution coming, the AI revolution. LLM brings not only information but also knowledge, it a big database of almost all human generated knowledge, the information cheasing is over, and we almost don't have to cheasing the change of knowledge, because the AI is doing it better than us already.

How to overcome the complexity of the world? Is that a task left for AI?

## VUCA

VUCA is an acronym used to describe or reflect on the **v**olatility, **u**ncertainty, **c**omplexity and **a**mbiguity of general conditions and situations. The common usage of the term VUCA began in the 1990s and derives from military vocabulary and has been subsequently used in emerging ideas in strategic leadership that apply in a wide range of organizations, including everything from for-profit corporations to education.

We live in a world that everything is changing more and more rapidly.
