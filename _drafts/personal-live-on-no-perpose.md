In the movie "The Shawshank Redemption", the main character Andy Dufresne said:

> Get busy living, or get busy dying.

It's a good point. But why do we get busy? We get busy in doing what?

I think the answer is: we get busy in doing what we think is meaningful.

What's does living mean with out some purpose? Where can we find the purpose? Or who can tell us the purpose of our life?

If someone tells you the purpose of **your** life, is that your purpose? Or is someone else's purpose? Or even worse, is that someone wants to control you for their own purpose?
