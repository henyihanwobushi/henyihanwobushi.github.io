Everybody like sunshine. Somebody like rain.

I don't hate the rain. I'd like to walk in the rain. I'd like to ride in the rain. I'd like sing in the rain.

But some day, I realize is not that I like the rain, but I like myself in the rain.

I like the rain, because I like myself.

Just like the singer in the rain, he is happy not because of the rain, but because of himself.

I like myself, even in the rain.

The life will go on, we will find some way to like ourselves anyway, even it's raining.

The meaning of life is to make yourself someone you like. So, what you like defines who you are.

You will make bad decisions, your life will be full of regrets. There will be no one to blame, but yourself. You will make good decisions, your life will be full of happiness. Also, there will be no one to thank, but yourself.

Someone call this destiny, someone call this fate. I call this life.

Life is a journey, you will never know what will happen next. You will never know what will happen in the end. But you can always choose to like yourself, no matter what happens.

You will sing in the rain. You will be happy again.
